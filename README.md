My NixOS Configuration

Welcome to my NixOS configuration repository! This setup is inspired by ZaneyOS and tailored to my personal needs. There is a script avaiable in repo which should jump start my flake but try it at your own risk.

Flake checkup

The Determinate Flake Checker Action scanned your flake.lock and didn't identify any issues. All Nixpkgs inputs:

✅ Use supported branches
✅ Are less than 30 days old
✅ Use upstream Nixpkgs
